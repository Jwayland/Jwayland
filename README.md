### Hello Friends!

## About Me
My name is Jordan Wayland. 
I have a diverse background in construction and architecture, and a HUGE interest in programming, automation, finance, and virtual reality technology.
I know what you are thinking, virtual reality and finance? How are those related? The answer is, they really aren't. I just enjoy learning about both.

# Virtual Reality
With a background in architecture (specifically 3D scanning, building mapping, and 360 photography), I had a will to learn more about the virtual frontier of this technology.
I have an interest in interactive 3D building touring services and technology. I am excited to see what the future will bring with this tech, and I want to stay current with my knowledge as the industry evolves.

# Finance
Now for finance. Money makes the world turn. I love working with money. I love budgeting my own life and saving for my own future goals. I love the power of compounding interest.
If utilized correctly, you can get free stuff. Who doesn't love free stuff? My plan is to provide an R platform to help like-minded tech professionals navigate planning for retirement and life goals.
I worked a number of years as an estimator for the world's largest landscape company in Orlando, FL. I was responsible for pricing landscape, irrigation, and hardscape projects for huge contracts with Disney and Universal Studios. 
I like analyzing money, making the best use of it, and using code to optimize decisions where ever possible. I decided to lean into my love for finance and get an MBA through Louisiana State University with a concentration in Finance. 

#github
Recently, I started uploading past projects to github with intentions to continue to provide content in the future. I want to share my knowledge and passion for VR and finance with the world.
As we get old, our interest and passions change. I will do my best to link my passions to automations, code, and projects, so I can share with you all in the future.
